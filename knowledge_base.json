It's based on the astrological position of Jupiter, the Sun, and the Moon. Millions of pilgrims, sadhus (holy men), and tourists gather to take a holy dip in the Ganges during this auspicious time.\n\n**The Legend**:\nAccording to mythology, during the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), drops of Amrit (nectar of immortality) fell at four places: Haridwar, Prayagraj, Nashik, and Ujjain. These are the four Kumbh Mela sites.\n\n**Types of Kumbh Mela**:\n- **Maha Kumbh**: Every 12 years (next in Haridwar: 2033)\n- **Ardh Kumbh**: Every 6 years (half Kumbh)\n- **Kumbh Mela**: Regular occurrence based on planetary positions\n\n**What Happens**:\n- Millions of devotees take holy dips in the Ganges\n- Sadhus from various akharas (sects) participate\n- Spiritual discourses and religious activities\n- Cultural programs and exhibitions\n- Temporary cities are set up with infrastructure\n\n**Significance**:\nTaking a dip during Kumbh Mela is believed to wash away all sins and lead to moksha (liberation). The event represents the unity of diverse spiritual traditions in India."

This is the peak tourist season.\n• **April to June**: Hot but manageable, good for temple visits (25°C to 40°C). Early mornings and evenings are comfortable.\n• **July to September**: Monsoon season, fewer crowds but occasional heavy rains. Some outdoor activities may be limited.\n• **Festival Season**: Diwali, Holi, and Makar Sankranti are great times to experience local culture (but expect crowds).\n• **Kumbh Mela Period**: If visiting during Kumbh Mela (every 12 years), expect massive crowds but a unique spiritual experience.\n\n**Avoid**: Peak summer (May-June) if you're sensitive to heat. Monsoon (July-August) if you prefer dry weather.\n\n**Best Months**: October, November, February, March for ideal weather and fewer crowds."

Keep valuables secure.\n• **Ghat Safety**: Be careful near ghats, especially during monsoon when water levels are high. Don't venture into deep water.\n• **Valuables**: Keep valuables secure, avoid displaying expensive items. Use hotel safes when available.\n• **Photography**: Ask permission before photographing people, especially sadhus. Some places may have photography restrictions.\n• **Water**: Drink bottled or filtered water. Avoid tap water to prevent stomach issues.\n• **Food**: Eat at clean, reputable places, especially if you have a sensitive stomach. Stick to freshly prepared food.\n• **Bargaining**: Negotiate prices for auto-rickshaws and souvenirs. Know approximate rates before negotiating.\n• **Emergency Contacts**: Save emergency numbers in your phone. Keep a written copy as backup.\n• **Documents**: Keep copies of important documents separate from originals. Store digital copies in cloud.\n• **Solo Travelers**: Haridwar is generally safe, but exercise normal precautions, especially at night.\n• **Temple Etiquette**: Follow temple rules, remove shoes where required, and respect local customs.\n• **Cable Cars**: Follow safety instructions in cable cars. Don't overcrowd or lean out."
